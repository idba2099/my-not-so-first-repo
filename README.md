A repository for learning Github

My name is Isaiah Ayres and I'm currently, as of 10/17/2024, in CSC-222-F01: Object-Oriented Programming. Some of my hobbies include playing various games, playing with my pet dog and cat, hanging out with friends and coding. I've taken classes to learn Java, Python, and C.
